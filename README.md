# Etch-a-sketch 🖼️
This project is a digital recreation of the classic Etch-A-Sketch project, implemented using Python's Turtle graphics library. With this application, you can draw on the screen using simple keyboard controls, simulating the experience of the traditional Etch-A-Sketch.

##  Features 😊
* Draw on the screen: Use arrow keys to move the "pen" and create drawings.<br>
* Clear the screen: Press the "C" key to reset the canvas.<br>
* Use the "M" -> move forwards, "B" -> move backwards, "A" -> move anticlockwise, "W" -> move clockwise. <br>
